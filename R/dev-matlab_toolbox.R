#' @title Process Toolbox HRV
#'
#' @description Takes the output from HRV Toolbox and converts it for analysis.
#'   Uses the package [data.table::fread()] for reading in data due to
#'   size/speed.
#'
#' @details The data is taken sequentially (sliding windows), and
#'   summarized over the course of certain time lengths. The data comes
#'   in a standardized pattern from the toolbox. It requires processing
#'   due to its large file sizes (e.g. 24 hours of data for a single
#'   patient can be up to 2 MB in size).
#'
#' @param loc Location of the folder that contains all of the patients
#'   that were analyzed by the Main_HRV_Analysis.m function from the
#'   Toolbox.
#'
#' @param name Name of the patient/ID. There should exist a folder with
#'   the name inside the `loc` folder. Inside this folder are all the
#'   Toolbox parameters and HRV results in CSV format.
#'
#' @param time Number of seconds to group the HRV data by. Defaults to
#'   3600 seconds (which is 1 hour)
#'
#' @return Data frame of HRV summarized by the grouping variable (e.g.
#'   3600 seconds = 1 hour). Also returns an additional column of
#'   percent missing (e.g. 20.0% missing data) by time group.

#' @title Read in Toolbox HRV
#'
#' @description Takes the output from HRV Toolbox and reads it in for an
#'   individual patient. Unlike [card::proc_hrv_matlab], this does not process
#'   or summarize the data, it just reads it the raw analysis. Uses the package
#'   [data.table::fread()] for reading in data due to size/speed.
#'
#' @details The data is taken sequentially (sliding windows), and is not processed. It is reported and is likely a large file.
#'
#' @param loc Location of the folder that contains all of the patients
#'   that were analyzed by the Main_HRV_Analysis.m function from the
#'   Toolbox
#'
#' @param name Name of the patient/ID. There should exist a folder with
#'   the name inside the `loc` folder. Inside this folder are all the
